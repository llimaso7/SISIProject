1. A document/a short overview about what is eliza (see more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)
2. Implement logic (see more https://www.smallsurething.com/implementing-the-famous-eliza-chatbot-in-python/)
I personally think it's better to have a small data base for the data.
We can also embedden it in the implementation of eliza as above
    2.1 A data base 
    2.2 An algorithm to represent the chat bot
3. An small GUI for user to interact (see more http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/)
